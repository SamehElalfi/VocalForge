    "# Formatting refined audio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to apply `VocalForge.text` pipelines on audio files either manually processed or through through `VocalForge.audio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is a step toward converting plain audio file(s) into a standardized format that is perfect for TTS training, speaker identification, or content Analysis (and more). These can be used independently of eachother, so if theres a step that isn't useful to you, feel free to simply skip it. This demo is just showing all capabilities of VocalForge. The final output of this dataset follows the same format to [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) but the class can be pretty easily modified to export another format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipelines are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Transcribe` Using OpenAI's Whisper, it goes through each file and, well, transcribes them into a text document. Pretty self explicatory. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `NormalizeText` Taking the raw text from Whisper, NormalizeText will output three text files, along with a copied version of the input audio file. The three text files split the text into utterances, such as sentences or exclamations. Each file will vary in terms of text normalization in order to expand compatibility with any range of preprocessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Segment` generates timestamps (and confidence levels) for each utterence generated from `NormalizeText` that matches to segments of the audio file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SplitAudio` is also very straightforward. It splits the audio file based on timestamps, assuming the segment reaches a certain confidence level (alongwith offsets and padding, but we will get to that)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Export` combines the text generated from `NormalizeText` and the audio files from `SplitAudio` in a nice little folder, alongwith a metadata file.\n",
    "\n",
    "More pipelines are coming soonâ„¢\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: It is highly reccomended to run this on a conda enviroment if running locally by running the command\n",
